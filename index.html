  <b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>
The web consists of people and computers communicating with each other via 3 main components:<br>
* browser - computer/human interface for the web; i.e., Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome<br>
* internet - the world's largest computer network<br>
* servers - host files with content including text, audio, images and video<br>
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". For more information about current HTML standards check out <a href = "http://www.w3.org/html/">the w3.org page</a>.
</p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>
HTML elements consist of HTML tags + content.  The tags contain formatting information telling the browser how the associated content should appear and function; i.e., <b>bold</b>, <em>italicized</em>, simple content or a <a href = "http://www.udacity.com">link to another webpage</a>.  Most HTML tags have the format <b>
&lt;opening tag&gt; <em>content </em>&lt;/closing tag&gt;</b> although some, like the image source tag, are designed without a closing tag.
</p>
<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>
Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause unintended behavior in a program.
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>
HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them, imparting additional formating attributes.
